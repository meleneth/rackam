I want to use pthreads.  As far as I know it is the only way to get hardware into the thread mix.

Main thread: spawns worker threads then calls join()

web listener thread

web response thread(x) (one per active web_response)

worker thread(x) (one per active newsgroup connection + one per active [decode, par2-verify, extract])

Lolz.  Threadz workz nowz.

Ok, moving on.

Currently the rackam object handles all the parsing.
Need a seperate parser object, to encapsulate all the threading stuff.
HeaderParser ->
  Multithreaded Grand Central Station for a import job.
  newsgroup
  header string
  Tokenize->subject->pieces

But I only get 1 param passed in to the thread.

I need to pass 2 things, the newsgroup and the pointer the vector of strings to parse.
Make a struct to pass them in?  Solves, feels ugly.  Solves.  Yarp.
