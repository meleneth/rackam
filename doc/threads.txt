I want to use pthreads.  As far as I know it is the only way to get hardware into the thread mix.

Main thread: spawns worker threads then calls join()

web listener thread

web response thread(x) (one per active web_response)

worker thread(x) (one per active newsgroup connection + one per active [decode, par2-verify, extract])
